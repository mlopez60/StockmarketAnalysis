Use VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data

Using various tools we learned so far, such as for loops, conditionals, formatting, nextcells, I analyzed stock market data to determine certain criteria: Total volume, yearly change, percent change. 

The VBA script file is saved in this repo as stockmarket vba.bas
The generated data is attached as well as multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm

Screenshots of my results are located in the repo as well.

Please reach out if you have any questions!
